The mobile application is designed to be used by families who need to manage their expenses across different categories. The purpose of this application is to keep track of every expense made over time and planned expenses, enabling users to save money and understand where every penny goes. This helps users think twice before making a purchase, depending on how necessary that purchase is.

The login activity is created so that each family member can add their expenses. These expenses are stored in a database, where users can consult and add expenses, as well as delete those that have already been paid and no longer need to be tracked.

The main activity consists of six sections, four of which are for registering expenses in each category. One section is dedicated to viewing the history of all expenses, and the other section features a calendar for upcoming payments.
